What great management looks like in [an open organization](https://github.com/open-organization-ambassadors/open-org-definition).

## Frequently asked questions

### What are the Open Management Practices?
Great managers are critical to business results, organizational culture, and employee experience. The Open Management Practices (OMPs) are intended to help managers succeed in their critical role. The OMPs clarify the role of the manager and describe what great management looks like in Red Hat's open culture. Red Hat shares these practices because many are applicable to other open organizations, who can adapt them to fit their respective industries and organizational cultures.

### Where did the Open Management Practices come from?
Red Hat released the Open Management Practices internally in 2019, after more than a year of collaborative development. Using the [Open Decision Framework](https://github.com/red-hat-people-team/open-decision-framework), more than 1,300 Red Hat associates, managers, and senior leaders across every organizational function and geographic region contributed to the discovery of the practices and created the document's initial release. The Open Management Practices underscore Red Hat's commitment to delivering an exceptional associate experience, sustaining open culture, and driving innovation for its customers. Red Hat made the work globally available as an upstream open source resource in early 2020.

### Who are the Open Management Practices for?
Understanding the benefits and challenges of applying open principles to people management is a responsibility everyone shares. Managers have an enormous impact on people's experience of an organizational culture and the way that culture contributes to the organization's ability to achieve business results. Associates play a critical role in supporting open management by providing thoughtful feedback to their managers. As such, the Open Management Practices are meant for an organization's managers and individual contributors alike.
